## Flix Development Scripts

This is a collection of scripts used for development of the Flix programming language.


## Contributing

Contributions (especially from other Flix contributors) are welcome.

In general, scripts should follow the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) when possible.

All scripts should use [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case) and be executable (`chmod +x <script>`).
